v1

TODO:

if there is no pdf in the dropzone, the button should open a file selector
    if there IS a pdf in the dropzone, then it should try to mail the pdf

add ability to remove a pdf file from the dropzone (an x button maybe?)
send an email reciept once we know lob has recieved the job?
do we support countries other than united states? if not, remove the country dropdown from both To and From
    and in that case we can put address1 and 2 on the same line (half and half)
    and we can put city/state/zip on the same line too (for both to and from)
    
its possible to charge for sending a pdf even though the lob api call could fail

highlight the form fields that are incorrect in an incorrect case
    such as making the borders of the fields red when its incorrect so its clear to the user which address is wrong.
    
    // style="border-style: solid; border-color: red;

prevent the site from making more than $10 worth of requests per day?
make sure we're never charging too little (or less than what lob is charging).?

actually rank in google for some of the search results
    post to hacker news & reddit

v2

add ability to do bulk mailing
    - upload text file of addresses for To, and a single pdf
    - then make all the correct lob api calls to mail each one.

have a way for people to easily convert documents to PDF (maybe not necessary for most people)
think about a mobile-centric version of the site, one that's easy to use from an iphone.
