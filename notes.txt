v1

TODO:

prevent the site from making more than $10 worth of requests per day
make sure we're never charging too little (or less than what lob is charging).

disable mailmypdf button after its been pressed.
re-enable it after lob job has been created.
explore if the form needs a minimum width for when the browser window is closed.
think about a mobile-centric version of the site, one that's easy to use from an iphone.


actually rank in google for some of the search results
    post to stack overflow
    hacker news
    have good text on the front page indicating what the purpose is

have a way for people to easily convert documents to PDF (maybe not necessary for most people)


v2
email to mail gateway
    email mailthis@mailmypdf.com
    attach pdf
    body is address you want to mail to
    automatically charges your card
    uses your saved address
    can reply when there is an error

take list of email addresses

fill out pdf form from email or elsewhere, and then re-email it or send it via mail

send pdf via fax ( fax the pdf instead of making a lob mailing api call )
