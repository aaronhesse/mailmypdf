v1

TODO:

move api keys to environment variables inside of GAE (stored in app.yaml maybe?)

its possible to charge for sending a pdf even though the lob api call could fail
    implement automatic refunds in this case

prevent the site from making more than $10 worth of requests per day? (during testing/beta)
make sure we're never charging too little (or less than what lob is charging).?

actually rank in google for some of the search results
    post to hacker news & reddit

v2

send the lob reciept email to the pdf sender.
 - this cant be done. we need to use the lobapi to get the estimated delivery date
 - then create our own reciept that we send through SMTP

add ability to do bulk mailing
    - upload text file of addresses for To, and a single pdf
    - then make all the correct lob api calls to mail each one.

have a way for people to easily convert documents to PDF (maybe not necessary for most people)
think about a mobile-centric version of the site, one that's easy to use from an iphone.
