v1

TODO:

make sure indicating that the src / dest addresses are incorrect is working for both cases.
add support for when both dest/src addresses are both incorrect

make the form well shake when indicating one of the addresses is incorrect/invalid (like the stripe modal does)

think about printing options that lob supports ie b&w, front&back or just front, etc.

change address handling to get the address from the fields ONCE, then retrieve the addresses from Lob maybe?

dont shift around the UI when showing / hiding the notification banner.

remove history for all files which have ever included api keys:
    mailmypdf.py
    lob.py
    
maybe write a python script to add the keys from a GAE, but git ignored file (apikeys.txt), to app.yaml,
then call appcfg.py update ., then remove the keys from app.yaml, this way app.yaml stays in git control?

prevent the site from making more than $10 worth of requests per day? (during testing/beta)
make sure we're never charging too little (or less than what lob is charging).?

actually rank in google for some of the search results

v2

send the lob reciept email to the pdf sender.
 - this cant be done. we need to use the lobapi to get the estimated delivery date
 - then create our own reciept that we send through SMTP

add ability to do bulk mailing
    - upload text file of addresses for To, and a single pdf
    - then make all the correct lob api calls to mail each one.

have a way for people to easily convert documents to PDF (maybe not necessary for most people)
think about a mobile-centric version of the site, one that's easy to use from an iphone.
